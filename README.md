# todo-app-mono


## assignment
Create a ToDo list app (both Backend and Frontend) which supports adding, updating,  removing to do items, as well as mark them done.

Backend in NodeJS; Frontend in Angular or React. Use typescript.

Remarks (how we will value your delivery):

1. API first. We should be able to use the backend part only and do all required  operations on the list by sending API requests. 
2. Clean and clear code
3. Easy setup and delivery
4. Production environment mindset
5. Other things we expect to see that will come from you, without specific guidelines
